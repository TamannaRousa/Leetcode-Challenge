## 👉🏻🎯 LeetCode Challenge Solutions 

This repository contains my solutions to various LeetCode challenges. Each solution is implemented in a specific programming language and organized by the challenge's name and number.

🖇📌Structure

- Each challenge solution is contained within its own directory named after the challenge's number and name.
- Within each challenge directory, you'll find:
  - The solution file(s) named according to the programming language used (e.g., `solution.py`, `solution.java`, etc.).
  - A README.md file providing a brief description of the problem and the approach used to solve it.
  - Any additional files or resources necessary for understanding the solution.

🖇📌Languages Used

- Java
